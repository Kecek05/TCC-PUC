# Project Context

Multiplayer tower defense game (Clash Royale-style) — university project (TCC - PUC).
Stack: Unity, Netcode for GameObjects, Odin Inspector, DOTween.

## User Preferences

- Values SOLID principles and scalable architecture
- Prefers discussion about design trade-offs before implementing
- Works across multiple PCs

## Architecture Decisions

### Card Validation System

Card activation uses a composable validation chain via `CardValidation` struct (not raw bool or Predicate<T>).

**Why:** Cards have shared base predicates (mana cost) and type-specific ones (buildable needs position check, spell does not). A bool loses the failure reason needed for UI feedback. A Predicate delegate loses Unity Inspector visibility and stack clarity.

**How it works:**
- `AbstractCard` implements `ICardActivatable` and owns the base mana check in `CanPlayCard()`
- `CanPlayCardAt()` defaults to `CanPlayCard()` — cards that don't need position checks (spells) inherit this for free
- Subclasses override and chain `base.CanPlayCard()` / `base.CanPlayCardAt()` to add their own checks (e.g. BuildableCard adds position + waitingResult)
- `CardValidation` struct carries `IsValid` + `CardInvalidReason` enum, with `implicit operator bool` for ergonomic if-checks
- `OnEndDrag` in AbstractCard handles the validate-then-activate flow — subclasses only override the three ICardActivatable methods
- Key files: `CardValidation.cs`, `ICardActivatable.cs`, `AbstractCard.cs`, `BuildableCard.cs` (all under `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Cards/`)

### Buff System — stacking speed modifiers (enemies)

Persistent buff spells (e.g. Rage) apply their effect through an additive **accumulator** on the entity, not a single multiplier — the enemy-side twin of the tower attack-speed buff (`BaseServerTowerCombat.AddAttackSpeedBuff`/`RemoveAttackSpeedBuff`).

**Why:** Multiple independent sources (overlapping Rage zones, a future slow) must stack and be removed independently without clobbering each other. `ServerEnemyMovement`'s original single `SetSpeedMultiplier` (last-writer-wins) couldn't express "+20% from zone A *and* +20% from zone B, each removable on its own." Keeping buffs as a separate accumulated term also means slows/upgrades that recompute base speed never wipe an active buff.

**How it works:**
- `ServerEnemyMovement` composes speed from independent terms: `effective = baseSpeed * slowMultiplier * (1 + speedBuffPercent)`, recomputed in `RecalculateSpeed()`. `SetSpeedMultiplier` feeds the slow term; `AddSpeedBuff(p)`/`RemoveSpeedBuff(p)` (clamped ≥ 0) feed the additive buff term.
- **Zero bandwidth:** no new NetworkVariable — the speed change replicates for free via the existing `PathProgress` sync; buffs are pure server-side state.
- Zone spells run one server coroutine (`RageExecutor`, modeled on `HasteExecutor`): re-scan each tick, apply the bonus **once per troop per cast** (tracked in a dict), and on expiry remove exactly this cast's own contribution. Rage adds a per-troop **linger** (buff persists N seconds after a troop leaves the radius / the zone ends).
- **Team targeting:** an enemy's `EntityTeam` is set to the *map it attacks* in `ServerWaveManager.SpawnEnemy` — identically for wave and player-sent troops — so an enemy-field spell filters `enemyTeam != casterTeam && != None` to hit both kinds. Mirrors `IceExecutor`.
- Key files: `ServerEnemyMovement.cs`, `RageExecutor.cs`, `SpellRageDataSO.cs` (under `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/`), with `BaseServerTowerCombat.cs` (tower-side twin) and `HasteExecutor.cs` (the zone pattern) as references.
